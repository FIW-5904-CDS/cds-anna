1.	General Info
a.	Proposed Title: Forest History/Shifts in day Roost Characteristics of Coastal Northern long-eared myotis maternity colony
b.	Likely coauthors: Katherine Gorman, Mark Ford
c.	Proposed journal (1st choice): no idea
d.	Proposed journal (backup): no idea

2.	The overarching question of this paper is [enter question here]
3.	Which is important/interesting/unresolved because (1-4 reasons)
a.	Northern long-eared bats (MYSE) are federally endangered and threatened by extinction due to white-nose syndrome.
b.	MYSE habitat is fragmented by development
c.	To inform future monitoring and management protocols
d.	[fill in]
4.	To answer this question/explore this topic, I addressed the following objectives: (NB you can have more or less than 3 objectives, but I recommend 2-4)
a.	Examine changes in how the coastal landscape is being utilized by MYSE maternity colonies (what type of forest stands/trees are being utilized as day roosts)
b.	Explore the social dynamics of maternity colony by creating a model of fission-fusion behavior
c.	[fill in]
5.	I addressed these objectives: (use list/bullet points below)
a.	In Fire Island National Seashore 
b.	With the following focal/model species/model system: maternity colony of Northern long-eared myotis
c.	And the following approaches: 1. Acoustics 2. Capture surveys 3. Roost data collection 4. Emergence counts
6.	Each row of data in my dataset is a _bat, tree, bat pass_______. 
7.	For my analysis, I want to test: significant variables in day roost selection 
8.	My response (y-axis) variable is: presence of bat, change in bat presence
9.	My predictors (x-axis/colors/shapes on the graph) are: type of roost, tree species, decay stage, DBH/height of trees, distance from other roosts, distance from roads, distance from forest
10.	I replicated this across multiple [days, years]
11.	I think I will need to analyze these data using a ANOVA
12.	I anticipate I will get a final figure(s) that will look like this [network visualization for colonies]
