- Proposed Title: Forest History/Shifts in day Roost Characteristics of Coastal Northern long-eared myotis maternity colony
- Likely coauthors: Katherine Gorman, Mark Ford
- Proposed journal (1st choice): no idea
- Proposed journal (backup): no idea

## The overarching question of this paper is how are preferred day roost selections changing over time?
---
## Which is important/interesting/unresolved because
- Northern long-eared bats (MYSE) are federally endangered and threatened by extinction due to white-nose syndrome.
- MYSE habitat is fragmented by development
- To inform future monitoring and management protocols, it is imperative to know how MYSE maternity colonies use the landscape as a network
---
## To answer this question/explore this topic, I addressed the following objectives: 
- Examine changes in how the coastal landscape is being utilized by MYSE maternity colonies (what type of forest stands/trees are being utilized as day roosts)
- Explore the social dynamics of maternity colony by creating a model of fission-fusion behavior
- Determine the forest stand age class and identify key extreme climatic events by coring roost trees
---
## I addressed these objectives: 
- In Fire Island National Seashore 
- With the following focal/model species/model system: maternity colony of Northern long-eared myotis
- And the following approaches: 1. Acoustics 2. Capture surveys 3. Roost data collection 4. Emergence counts 5. tree core sampling
---
## Each row of data in my dataset is a _bat, roost tree, bat pass_______. 
- For my analysis, I want to test: significant variables in day roost selection 
- My response (y-axis) variable is: presence of bat, change in bat presence, 
- My predictors (x-axis/colors/shapes on the graph) are: age of tree, type of roost, tree species, decay stage, DBH/height of trees, distance from other roosts, distance from roads, distance from forest
- I replicated this across multiple [days, years]
- I think I will need to analyze these data using a ANOVA, kernel density
- I anticipate I will get a final figure(s) that will look like this [network visualization for colonies]
